ONLY MAIN LOGIC IS HERE , OTHER CODE IS INSIDE CPANEL
# Problem Statement 

 
 currently have a personal single "static" page blog of book reviews. 

Each "post" is just me adding text to my index.html file and re-uploading, for each "post" I have the book Title, Cover Image, Author, Publisher, Link to Amazon, etc. along with the text of my review of the book. 

I also have a "database" (Excel spread sheet) of all this info (except the text of the blog post which is just written in the html file).

I would like to ask if you would consider taking on the job of:

1. Converting an Excel spread sheet of book titles and related data into a MySQL database.

2. Taking a static HTML blog and producing a "template post" that I can use to link to the SQL database and facilitate updates and make new blog posts easier.
